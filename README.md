## Marlin 2.1 Bugfix Branch

__Not for production use. Use with caution!__

Marlin 2.1 takes this popular RepRap firmware to the next level by adding support for much faster 32-bit and ARM-based boards while improving support for 8-bit AVR boards. Read about Marlin's decision to use a "Hardware Abstraction Layer" below.

This branch is for patches to the latest 2.1.x release version. Periodically this branch will form the basis for the next minor 2.1.x release.

Download earlier versions of Marlin on the [Releases page](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/releases).

## Example Configurations

Before building Marlin you'll need to configure it for your specific hardware. Your vendor should have already provided source code with configurations for the installed firmware, but if you ever decide to upgrade you'll need updated configuration files. Marlin users have contributed dozens of tested example configurations to get you started. Visit the [MarlinFirmware/Configurations](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Configurations) repository to find the right configuration for your hardware.

## Building Marlin 2.0

Before you can build Marlin for your machine you'll need a configuration for your specific hardware. Upon request, your vendor will be happy to provide you with the complete source code and configurations for your machine, but you'll need to get updated configuration files if you want to install a newer version of Marlin. Fortunately, Marlin users have contributed dozens of tested configurations to get you started. Visit the [MarlinFirmware/Configurations](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Configurations) repository to find the right configuration for your hardware.

## Building Marlin 2.1

To build and upload Marlin you will use one of these tools:

- The free [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) using the [Auto Build Marlin](https://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/auto_build_marlin.html) extension.
- The free [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) : See [Building Marlin with Arduino](https://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_arduino.html)
- You can also use VSCode with devcontainer : See [Installing Marlin (VSCode devcontainer)](http://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_devcontainer_vscode.html).

Marlin is optimized to build with the **PlatformIO IDE** extension for **Visual Studio Code**. You can still build Marlin with **Arduino IDE**, and we hope to improve the Arduino build experience, but at this time PlatformIO is the better choice.

## 8-Bit AVR Boards

We intend to continue supporting 8-bit AVR boards in perpetuity, maintaining a single codebase that can apply to all machines. We want casual hobbyists and tinkerers and owners of older machines to benefit from the community's innovations just as much as those with fancier machines. Plus, those old AVR-based machines are often the best for your testing and feedback!

## Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)

Marlin includes an abstraction layer to provide a common API for all the platforms it targets. This allows Marlin code to address the details of motion and user interface tasks at the lowest and highest levels with no system overhead, tying all events directly to the hardware clock.

## Submitting Patches

Proposed patches should be submitted as a Pull Request against the ([bugfix-2.0.x](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/tree/bugfix-2.0.x)) branch.

- This branch is for fixing bugs and integrating any new features for the duration of the Marlin 2.0.x life-cycle.
- Follow the [Coding Standards](https://marlinfw.org/docs/development/coding_standards.html) to gain points with the maintainers.
- Please submit Feature Requests and Bug Reports to the [Issue Queue](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/issues/new/choose). See above for user support.
- Whenever you add new features, be sure to add one or more build tests to `buildroot/tests`. Any tests added to a PR will be run within that PR on GitHub servers as soon as they are pushed. To minimize iteration be sure to run your new tests locally, if possible.
  - Local build tests:
    - All: `make tests-config-all-local`
    - Single: `make tests-config-single-local TEST_TARGET=...`
  - Local build tests in Docker:
    - All: `make tests-config-all-local-docker`
    - Single: `make tests-config-all-local-docker TEST_TARGET=...`
  - To run all unit test suites:
    - Using PIO: `platformio run -t test-marlin`
    - Using Make: `make unit-test-all-local`
    - Using Docker + make: `maker unit-test-all-local-docker`
  - To run a single unit test suite:
    - Using PIO: `platformio run -t marlin_<test-suite-name>`
    - Using make: `make unit-test-single-local TEST_TARGET=<test-suite-name>`
    - Using Docker + make: `maker unit-test-single-local-docker TEST_TARGET=<test-suite-name>`
- If your feature can be unit tested, add one or more unit tests. For more information see our documentation on [Unit Tests](test).

## License

Marlin is published under the [GPL license](/LICENSE) because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.
